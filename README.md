## 🧠 About Me

I’m an ECE graduate passionate about designing smart, efficient systems by blending RTL design, VLSI, and machine learning. I’ve worked on real-world problems like wireless communication (MIMO-OFDM) and intelligent image classification using CNNs.

I enjoy building and optimizing systems across the stack—from Verilog-based digital design to Python-based ML models. Currently exploring GitHub, open-source workflows, and collaborative hardware/software development.
