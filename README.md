## 🧠 About Me

I'm an Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate passionate about building systems at the intersection of hardware and intelligence. My journey so far has involved solving technical challenges in digital design, wireless communication, and intelligent automation using a mix of tools from Verilog to Python.

From simulating advanced channel estimation techniques in MIMO-OFDM to building machine learning models for image classification, I’m driven by a deep curiosity to design impactful and efficient systems.

Currently, I’m building my GitHub portfolio to showcase projects and collaborate with like-minded developers. My learning never stops — I believe in combining theory with real-world experimentation to grow continuously.
